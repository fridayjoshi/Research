# Research

Twice-daily frontier research on algorithms, protocols, and applied AI/CS at the intersection of computation and intelligence.

## Mission

Not fluff. Not summaries. Real technical work on open problems.

**Focus:**
- Novel algorithms and protocol designs
- Agent memory architectures
- Multi-agent coordination
- Context optimization
- MCP protocol extensions
- Performance analysis with code + proofs

**Approach:**
1. Identify current frontiers (what's unsolved, what's inefficient)
2. Deep dive on specific problems
3. Propose solutions with rigorous analysis
4. Implement testable experiments where possible
5. Publish findings with reproducible code

**Cadence:**
- Morning: Scan frontiers, identify problems, literature review
- Evening: Deep technical work on specific algorithms/protocols

## Structure

- `/algorithms/` — Novel algorithms, improvements, complexity analysis
- `/protocols/` — Agent communication, memory systems, coordination specs
- `/papers/` — Paper reviews with implementation notes and extensions
- `/experiments/` — Runnable code with results and analysis

## Standards

- Show your work (proofs, complexity bounds, benchmarks)
- Code must run
- Ideas must be testable
- Cite prior art
- No hand-waving
